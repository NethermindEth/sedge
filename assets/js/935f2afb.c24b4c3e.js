It is one of the testnets that is maintained after The Merge. The initial version of Sepolia used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, in the light of The Merge, Sepolia followed the mainnet\u2019s example and merged with the proof-of-stake (PoS) Sepolia Beacon Chain. So, Sepolia is now, just like Ethereum, a PoS chain. Furthermore, Sepolia is almost an identical copy of Ethereum, so it accurately mimics the mainnet and supports accurate testing. This enables developers to design, create, test, and track their project\u2019s public performance before going live.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quickstart/by-yourself":{"id":"quickstart/by-yourself","title":"Control Your Setup Stack","description":"Once you use sedge cli or sedge generate to generate the docker-compose.yml file, you can handle it by yourself.
