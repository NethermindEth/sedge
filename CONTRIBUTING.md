# Contributing to Sedge

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Sedge as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Bugs and Feature Request

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/issues/new/choose).

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- mockgen (for generating mocks)

### Installing mockgen

To generate mocks for testing, you need to install mockgen:

```bash
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@latest
```

Make sure `~/go/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

### Generating Mocks

When you modify interfaces that are used in tests, you may need to regenerate mocks:

```bash
go generate ./...
```

This will generate mock files for:
- `mocks/` - Main mock packages
- `internal/monitoring/mocks/` - Monitoring service mocks
- `internal/monitoring/locker/mocks/` - Locker mocks

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests for a specific package:

```bash
go test ./cli -v
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
