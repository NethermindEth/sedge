Sedge is a one-click node setup tool for PoS network/chain validators and nodes written entirely in the Go programming language. Sedge takes care of the entire on-premise full node setup based on the chosen client, using generated docker-compose scripts based on the desired configuration.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Dependencies

Sedge dependencies are `docker` with the `docker compose` plugin, but if you don't have those installed, Sedge will show instructions to install them or install them for you. Check the [docs](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/quickstart/dependencies) for more details.

### Installation methods

Check our [installation guide](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/quickstart/install-guide) for detailed instructions on the supported methods:

- Download the binary from the release page
- Using the Homebrew package manager
- Using the Go programming language
- Build from source

### **Disclaimer**

Downloading any binary from the internet risks downloading files that malicious, third-party actors have injected with malware. All users should check that they download the correct, clean binary from a reputable source.

## 📜 Documentation

You can check the [documentation](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io) for further details.

## ⚡️ Quick start

With `sedge cli` you can go through the entire workflow setup:

1. Generate a `docker-compose.yml` script with randomized clients selection and `.env` file
2. Generate validator keystore, or import it.
3. Check dependencies
4. Execute the `docker-compose.yml` script (only execution and consensus nodes will be executed by default)
5. Validator client will be executed automatically after the consensus node is synced.
  
You can also generate the validator(s) keystore folder using `sedge keys`.

The entire process is interactive. However, Sedge also has a very customizable, non-interactive setup without prompts.

If you want to run the [non-interactive mode](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/quickstart/complete-guide#22-non-interactive-setup), you will need to run only four commands (two if you are not running a validator and you don't need the validator keystore), and provide the set of arguments needed for each command.
1. `sedge generate`
2. `sedge keys`
3. `sedge import-key`
4. `sedge run`

Check all the options and flags with `sedge --help`.

## 💥 Why did we start Sedge?

As people who actively deployed validators way before The Merge, we know how hard it is to set up an Ethereum validator:

- You need to procure at least three (compatible) nodes: an execution node (geth, nethermind, erigon, etc), a consensus node, and a validator node (lighthouse, prysm, etc)
- You then need to execute them, connect them, monitor them, and secure the validator keys (which includes staking 32 ETH).
- There may be several valid combinations of clients to choose for your setup, so you need to go through each of the client's docs, evaluate it, get instructions for it and test it. You also need to feel comfortable executing commands in the cli, know docker, and understand basics of networking. On top of this, there are many different settings you must read up on and consider for your client node.
- In the case of working with the Ethereum Mainnet, you are working with real money that can potentially be lost in the event of having downtime or being slashed. To avoid losing real value, you must be aware of and follow best practices on the validator setup, and correctly monitor your nodes.
- Have you heard of MEV-Boost? You most likely want always to be running the latest version, but you also don’t have the time to understand the MEV-Boost architecture ins and outs or how to implement it into your environment successfully.
  
> Enter Sedge

We want Sedge to take care of all of the above for you. With just a few clicks or steps, Sedge can create an entire Ethereum staking architecture that supports client diversity and Ethereum's latest features, while being completely free and open source. We want Sedge to save you from making costly mistakes in this complex setup; along with hours or days of research, reading and testing. We want you to be able to stake easily with or without blockchain knowledge by giving you the tools to help this amazing community (and earn some good money of course 😉).

We want to share our knowledge in this topic and create something that allows everyone to easily and safely set up lots of diverse validators.

We don't want to stop at Ethereum. We also want to help stakers of other PoS networks/chains, so if your favourite chain is not here, you are more than welcome to contribute!

## 🔥 What can you do with Sedge today?

- Select an execution, consensus and validator client node (manually or automatically) and generate a `docker-compose.yml` script with production-tested configurations to run the setup you want.
- Set up only an execution, consensus, validator, or mev-boost instance.
- Don't remember `docker compose` commands or flags for your setup? Check docker logs of the running services with `sedge logs`, and shut them down with `sedge down`
- Generate the keystore folder with `sedge keys`  using our heavily tested own code.

> **Disclaimer:** Users acknowledge that generating the keystore for any network is an unaudited feature of Sedge. Nethermind provides this feature on an ‘as is’ basis and makes no warranties regarding its proper functioning. The use of this feature is at the user’s own risk - Nethermind excludes all liability for any malfunction or loss of money that may occur as the result of an unexpected behavior during the keystore generation.

If you are familiar with `docker`, `docker compose`, and the validator setup, then you can use `sedge cli` or `sedge generate` to create a base docker-compose script with the recommended settings and then edit the script as much as you want. It is a lot more easier than doing everything from scratch!

> Although Sedge supports several clients, some settings may not work if you use clients versions different from the default ones. Please let us know about any issues you encounter!

### **Disclaimer**

While Sedge assists in installing the validator, it is not designed to register or maintain it. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they monitor and maintain the validator as required, so that they do not incur penalties and/or financial losses. This includes promptly updating the tool to ensure the latest stable releases of clients are used.

Users acknowledge that no warranty is being made of a successful installation. Sedge is a tool and it ultimately depends on you to use it correctly and follow all the best practice guidance, as found in this README and documentation.
