Your full-node is up and running. If you set up new validator keys, you will have to register them. Follow https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ instructions to register the validator addresses of the validators you want to set up and manage using the validator node. If something goes wrong and your validator node is down, don't panic! Short downtimes are pretty decent. Check the logs and try to fix the errors. Ensure errors are not related to connection issues with the consensus nodes or to the keystore folder path or validator data directory. You can start the validator again using the instructions displayed by the tool.
	
Happy Staking!
