### Changed

- Improved test coverage
- Updated client versions
- Refactor `sedge cli` command to use the new sedge actions in a more interactive way.
- Rename sedge data directory name to `sedge-data` instead of `docker-compose-scripts`.
- Update mev-boost relay URLs.
- Fixed validator restart failure. Validator never restarts, but has a better and safer start-up method:
  - Validator waits a grace period (2 epochs) before starting.
  - Validator waits for the consensus sync to finish: verifying that the `/eth/v1/node/health` consensus endpoint
      returns with the HTTP code 200 in the newly added `validator-blocker` docker-compose service. This replace the
      older track sync method.
- Updated installation script for docker and docker compose in Linux flavours.
- Updated Checkpoint Sync Url for Goerli.
- Use new created action for JWT secret handling.
- Removed `v` from the tag on release scripts. Now we should use `Tag=v1.0.0` instead of `Tag=1.0.0`.
