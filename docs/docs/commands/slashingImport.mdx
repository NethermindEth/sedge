# Slashing Import

Running `sedge slashing-import` will import slashing protection data to the current validator client. The slashing protection data is a JSON file that meets with the [EIP-3076](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3076) specification.

## Help

```shell
$ sedge slashing-import --help

Import Slashing Protection Interchange Format (EIP-3076) data. This command assumes
that the validator client container exists, stopped or not and that its database
is already initialized. The validator database is initialized if the validator is
running or has already run but is stopped, and also after importing the validator keys.
This command stops the validator client during the importing process due to the
validator database being locked while it's running but leaves the validator client
in the same state in which it was found. That means if the validator is running/stopped
before the import, then the validator will be running/stopped after the command
is executed, regardless of whether the export fails or not. To force a different
behavior use --start-validator and --stop-validator flags.
The [validator] is a required argument used to specify which validator client, from
all supported by Sedge (lighthouse, lodestar, prysm or teku), is used to import the
Slashing Protection data. This is necessary because each client has its own way to
achieve the importation.

Usage:
  sedge slashing-import [flags] [validator]

Examples:

sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json prysm
sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json --stop-validator lodestar
sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json --start-validator lighthouse

Flags:
      --container-tag string   Container tag to use. If defined, sedge will add to each container and the network, a suffix with the tag. e.g. sedge-validator-client -> sedge-validator-client-<tag>.
  -f, --from string            path to the JSON file in the EIP-3076 format with the slashing protection data to import (default: <generation-dir>/slashing_protection.json)
  -h, --help                   help for slashing-import
  -n, --network string         network (default "mainnet")
  -p, --path string            path to the generation directory (default "/path/to/sedge-data")
      --start-validator        starts the validator client after import, regardless of the state the validator was in before
      --stop-validator         stops the validator client after import, regardless of the state the validator was in before

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")
```

## Execution Example

This is an example of importing slashing protection data to a setup using sepolia network and prysm as validator client that is already stopped at the moment of the import.

```shell
$ sedge slashing-import prysm -f slashing-export.json -n sepolia
2023-01-06 14:59:11 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Log level: info
2023-01-06 14:59:11 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v1.9.0
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 14:59:11 -- [INFO] Importing slashing data to client prysm from slashing-export.json
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 14:59:11 -- [INFO] The slashing protection container is starting...
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 14:59:12 -- [INFO] The slashing container ends successfully.
```

Notice in this case the validator client remains stopped because it has been stopped since before the import. If necessary the validator client could be started after the import using the `--start-validator` flag, for example:

```shell
$ sedge slashing-import prysm -f slashing-export.json -n sepolia --start-validator
2023-01-06 15:08:05 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Log level: info
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v1.9.0
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] Importing slashing data to client prysm from slashing-export.json
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] The slashing protection container is starting...
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] The slashing container ends successfully.
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] The validator container is being restarted
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:08:06 -- [INFO] Validator started.
```

Another case may be importing the slashing data protection when the validator is currently running, for example:

```shell
$ sedge slashing-import prysm -f slashing-export.json -n sepolia
2023-01-06 15:10:27 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Log level: info
2023-01-06 15:10:27 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v1.9.0
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:10:27 -- [INFO] Stopping validator client...
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:10:27 -- [INFO] stopping service: validator-client, currently on running status
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] Validator client stopped.
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] Importing slashing data to client prysm from slashing-export.json
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] The slashing protection container is starting...
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] The slashing container ends successfully.
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] The validator container is being restarted
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:10:28 -- [INFO] Validator started.
```

In this case, the validator client is stopped before the import and started again afterward. If necessary validator could be stopped after the import using the `--stop-validator` flag. for example:

 ```shell
$ sedge slashing-import prysm -f slashing-export.json -n sepolia --stop-validator
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Log level: info
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v1.9.0
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] Stopping validator client...
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] stopping service: validator-client, currently on running status
# highlight-next-line
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] Validator client stopped.
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] Importing slashing data to client prysm from slashing-export.json
2023-01-06 15:12:22 -- [INFO] The slashing protection container is starting...
2023-01-06 15:12:23 -- [INFO] The slashing container ends successfully.
 ```

In this case, the validator client is stopped before the import but is not started again afterward.
