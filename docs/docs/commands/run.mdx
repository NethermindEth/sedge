# Run

Running `sedge run` will run all the services in the docker-compose.yml file under
the generation folder. To run the services this sequence of actions are made:

- Build the necessary images (`docker compose build`)
- Pull the necessary images (`docker compose pull`)
- Create containers (`docker compose create`)
- Start containers (`docker compose up`)

:::info Skip `docker compose pull` action
To skip the `docker compose pull` command, the `--skip-pull` flag could be used. This is useful
when the images are already pulled or the user wants to use a local custom image.
:::

## Help

```shell
Run all the generated services

Usage:
  sedge run [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               help for run
  -p, --path string        generation path for sedge data (default "/home/root/sedge/sedge-data")
      --services strings   List of services to run. If this flag is not provided, all services will run.
      --skip-pull          Avoid pulling images before running containers. If the images are not available locally, this flag could cause an error.

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")
```

## Execution Example

:::info Docker dependency
The `run` command will first check if Docker is installed, if it is not installed
then Sedge tries to install it.
:::

Once the generated data is ready, services inside the docker-compose.yml file could
be run using the `sedge run` command.

:::caution Generate files first
The `run` command assumes that the generated files are ready to run.
:::

First, open a Terminal with access to the sedge binary to get started. Then run
the following command to start all services in the default generation path
`./docker-compose-scripts`.

```shell
$ sedge run

In the logs above, the commands logs are highlighted to better understand the sequence
of actions performed.

### Running a set of services

If it is no necessary to run all the services, then a set of services could be specified
using the `--services` flag. A good example will be running the execution and consensus
client initially without the validator to sync the nodes and after the synchronization
start the validator.

```shell
$ sedge run --services execution,consensus
Using config file: /root/.sedge.yaml
2022-12-29 21:03:29 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Logging configuration: {Level:debug}
2022-12-29 21:03:29 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v1.3.2
2022-12-29 21:03:29 -- [INFO] Checking dependencies: docker

2022-12-29 21:03:29 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml pull execution consensus

2022-12-29 21:03:30 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml create execution consensus
2022-12-29 21:03:30 -- [DEBU] Running command with sudo.
[+] Running 4/2
 ⠿ Network docker-compose-scripts_default  Created  0.1s
 ⠿ Network sedge_network                   Created  0.1s
 ⠿ Container consensus-client              Created  0.0s
 ⠿ Container execution-client              Created  0.1s

[+] Running 2/2
 ⠿ Container consensus-client  Started  0.6s
 ⠿ Container execution-client  Started  0.6s
```

Now, if you go to the folder with the generated docker compose and run
`docker compose ps` you can check the status of the execution and consensus services:

```logs
NAME                COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS               PORTS
consensus-client    "/app/cmd/beacon-cha…"   consensus           running (starting)   0.0.0.0:5054->5054/tcp, :::5054->5054/tcp, 4000-4001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp, :::9000->9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/udp, :::9000->9000/udp
execution-client    "./Nethermind.Runner…"   execution           running              8545/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8008->8008/tcp, :::8008->8008/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30303->30303/tcp, :::30303->30303/tcp, 8551/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30303->30303/udp, :::30303->30303/udp
```

Notice in this case consensus service is starting, that means is still syncing.
Now you can start the validator client like follow:

```shell
$ sedge run --services validator
Using config file: /root/.sedge.yaml
2022-12-29 21:24:12 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Logging configuration: {Level:debug}

# highlight-next-line
2022-12-29 21:24:13 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d validator

 ⠿ Container docker-compose-scripts-validator-blocker-1  Waiting  6.5s
```

After this, the validator service will wait until consensus syncs to start.
