# Generate

Running `sedge generate` with the different sub commands will generate the docker-compose file that will be used to run the nodes.

## Help

```
$ sedge generate -h
Generate new setups according to selected options and flags.

It will create a 'docker-compose.yml' and a '.env', which you will need later to run the docker-compose script. You can use 'sedge run' to run the script and start the setup.

You can generate:
- Full Node (execution + consensus + validator)
- Full Node without Validator (execution + consensus)
- Optimism Full Node
- Aztec Sequencer (execution + consensus + aztec-sequencer)
- Execution Node
- Consensus Node
- Validator Node
- Mev-Boost Instance
- Lido CSM node

Usage:
  sedge generate [command]

Available Commands:
  aztec-sequencer Generate a Aztec Sequencer node config
  consensus    Generate a consensus node config
  execution    Generate a execution node config
  full-node    Generate a full node config, with or without a validator
  mev-boost    Generate a mev-boost node config
  op-full-node Generate a full node config for Optimism or Base
  validator    Generate a validator node config

Flags:
      --container-tag string   Container tag to use. If defined, sedge will add to each container and the network, a suffix with the tag. e.g. sedge-validator-client -> sedge-validator-client-<tag>.
  -h, --help                   help for generate
      --lido                   generate Lido CSM node
      --logging string         Docker logging driver used by all the services. Set 'none' to use the default docker logging driver. Possible values: [none json] (default "json")
  -n, --network string         Target network. e.g. mainnet, sepolia, hoodi, gnosis, chiado, etc. (default "mainnet")
  -p, --path string            generation path for sedge data. Default is sedge-data (default "/path/to/sedge-data")

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")

Use "sedge generate [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Lido Flow

With the `--lido` flag, you can generate a Lido CSM node. This will generate a full node, a execution, a consensus, a validator or a mev-boost node with the Lido CSM configuration.

It will include in the configuration of the selected node:
- Lido Withdrawal Credentials
- Lido Fee Recipient Address
- Designated MEV-Boost Relay URL

### Sub Commands

#### Full-Node

:::caution

You should use `--fee-recipient` flag to set the fee recipient address if your setup includes a **validator**. If you don't set it, your priority fee earnings will be deposited into a burn address.

:::

```
$ sedge generate full-node -h
Generate a docker-compose and an environment file with a full node configuration.

It will not generate a validator configuration if the --no-validator flag is set to true.

On mainnet and sepolia mev-boost will be activated by default unless you run it with --no-mev-boost flag.

If you don't provide a execution, consensus or validator client, it will be chosen randomly. If one of the consensus or validator is provided, but the other one is omitted, then the same pair of clients will be used for both consensus and validator.

Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client, for example 'sedge generate full-node --execution nethermind:docker.image'. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name

Usage:
  sedge generate full-node [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --consensus string                  Consensus engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -e, --execution string                  Execution engine client, e.g. geth, nethermind, besu, erigon. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -v, --validator string                  Validator engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
      --distributed boolean               Deploy a node configured to run as part of a Distributed Validator Cluster.
  -d  --distributedValidator string       Distributed Validator client, e.g. charon. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
      --latest                            Use the latest version of clients. This sets the "latest" tag on the client's docker images. Latest version might not work.
      --checkpoint-sync-url string        Initial state endpoint (trusted synced consensus endpoint) for the consensus client to sync from a finalized checkpoint. Provide faster sync process for the consensus client and protect it from long-range attacks affored by Weak Subjetivity. Each network has a default checkpoint sync url.
      --fee-recipient string              Suggested fee recipient. Is a 20-byte Ethereum address which the execution layer might choose to set as the coinbase and the recipient of other fees or rewards. There is no guarantee that an execution node will use the suggested fee recipient to collect fees, it may use any address it chooses. It is assumed that an honest execution node will use the suggested fee recipient, but users should note this trust assumption.
                                          Note: When setting up a Lido node, fee recipient address will be automatically set by the system.
      --no-mev-boost                      Not use mev-boost if supported
  -m, --mev-boost-image string            Custom docker image to use for Mev Boost. Example: 'sedge generate full-node --mev-boost-image flashbots/mev-boost:latest-portable'

#### Op-Full-Node

```
$ sedge generate op-full-node -h
Generate a docker-compose and an environment file with a full node configuration for Optimism or Base networks.

This command sets up an Optimism or Base full node, which includes an execution client, a consensus client, a Optimism consensus client, and an Optimism node.

If you don't provide images for your clients, they will be chosen randomly. You can specify custom images for the Optimism and other nodes.

Use the --base flag to generate a configuration for a Base node (which is built on Optimism).

The command allows you to use external execution and consensus APIs instead of running your own nodes, by providing the respective URLs.

Additionally, you can use the syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client, for example 'sedge generate op-full-node --execution nethermind:custom.image'. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name.

This command does not generate a validator configuration, as Optimism and Base use different validation mechanisms compared to standard Ethereum networks.

#### Aztec-Sequencer

```
$ sedge generate aztec-sequencer -h
Generate a docker-compose and an environment file with a full node configuration for Aztec Sequencer networks.

This command sets up an Aztec Sequencer node, which includes an execution client, a consensus client, and a Aztec Sequencer client.

Additionally, you can use the syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client, for example 'sedge generate aztec-sequencer --execution nethermind:custom.image'. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name.

Required flags:
- `--aztec-keystore-path`
- `--aztec-p2p-ip`

Usage:
  sedge generate aztec-sequencer [flags]

Flags:
      --aztec-keystore-path string     Path to Aztec sequencer keystore.json file (required). The keystore must be generated using 'aztec validator-keys new' command. See https://docs.aztec.network/network/setup/sequencer_management for details.
      --aztec-p2p-ip string            P2P IP address for Aztec sequencer (required). This is the IP address that other nodes will use to connect to this sequencer.
      --aztec-sequencer-image string   Aztec Sequencer image.
      --aztec-extra-flag stringArray   Additional flag to configure the aztec sequencer service in the generated docker-compose script.
      --otel-metrics-port uint16       OTLP HTTP metrics port on the monitoring stack collector (default: 4318). The host is fixed to sedge_aztec_exporter and path to /v1/metrics.
  -c, --consensus string               Consensus engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus.
  -e, --execution string               Execution engine client, e.g. geth, nethermind, besu, erigon.
      --execution-api-url string       Set execution api url. If set, will omit the creation of execution and beacon nodes, and only create Aztec sequencer nodes.
      --consensus-url string           Set consensus api url. If set, will omit the creation of execution and beacon nodes, and only create Aztec sequencer nodes.
      --jwt-secret-path string         Path to the JWT secret file
      --map-all                        Map all clients ports to host. Use with care. Useful to allow remote access to the clients
  -n, --network string                 Target network. e.g. mainnet, sepolia etc. (default "mainnet")
  -p, --path string                    generation path for sedge data. Default is sedge-data (default "/path/to/sedge-data")
  -h, --help                           help for aztec-sequencer

Global Flags:
      --container-tag string   Container tag to use. If defined, sedge will add to each container and the network, a suffix with the tag. e.g. sedge-validator-client -> sedge-validator-client-<tag>.
      --lido                   generate Lido CSM node
      --log-level string       Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")
      --logging string         Docker logging driver used by all the services. Set 'none' to use the default docker logging driver. Possible values: [none json] (default "json")
```

Example (Sepolia):

```bash
sedge generate aztec-sequencer \
  --network sepolia \
  --execution nethermind \
  --consensus lighthouse \
  --aztec-keystore-path /path/to/keystore.json \
  --aztec-p2p-ip <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>
```

::::note Monitoring port

The generated environment config sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` to `http://sedge_aztec_exporter:<PORT>/v1/metrics`.

You can change the port using:

```bash
sedge generate aztec-sequencer --otel-metrics-port 4318
```
