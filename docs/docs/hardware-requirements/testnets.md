# Testnets

The Testnets (Sepolia) are lighter than Mainnet and hence the requirements are lower. The requirements depend heavily from the particular set of clients involved in the setup, but from our experience we can identify general requirements:

### Minimum

- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 300 GB solid state storage
- 100 Mbps download, 20 Mbps upload broadband connection

### Recommended

- 6 CPU cores
- 16 GB RAM
- 500-1000 GB solid state storage
- 1 Gbps download, 100 Mbps upload broadband connection
