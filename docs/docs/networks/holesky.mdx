# Holesky

Holesky is Ethereum's public testnet that serves as a technical experimentation platform for Ethereum's infrastructure, staking designs, and protocol-level developments. This testing environment brings its own set of validators, a dedicated block explorer, and an ecosystem of faucets.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on holesky by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge generate full-node` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge generate full-node --network=holesky --no-mev-boost=true
```
>>>>>>>> main:docs/docs/networks/holesky.mdx

## Generating a Full Node

To generate a setup of a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge generate full-node`. For example:

```bash
<<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/docs/networks/hoodi.mdx
sedge generate full-node --no-validator --network=hoodi
========
sedge generate full-node --no-validator --network=holesky
>>>>>>>> main:docs/docs/networks/holesky.mdx
```

## Generating a Full Node with a Validator

To generate a setup of a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
<<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/docs/networks/hoodi.mdx
sedge generate full-node --network=hoodi
========
sedge generate full-node --network=holesky
>>>>>>>> main:docs/docs/networks/holesky.mdx
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
<<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/docs/networks/hoodi.mdx
sedge keys --network hoodi
========
sedge keys --network holesky
>>>>>>>> main:docs/docs/networks/holesky.mdx
```

## Running your setup

Once you have generated your setup, you can run it with the following command:

```
sedge run
```
