# Mainnet

Mainnet is the public and decentralized network of Ethereum. It is the network that all validators participate in to
earn staking rewards, and it is the network that all users interact with to send transactions and store state. Mainnet is
secured by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on mainnet by default, in case you want to remove it from your setup,
run `sedge generate full-node` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge generate full-node --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Generating a Full Node

To generate a setup of a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge generate full-node`. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --no-validator
```

:::info

Sedge uses Mainnet as default network, therefore is not necessary to specify the target network.

## Generating a Full Node with a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys
```

## Running your setup

Once you have generated your setup, you can run it with the following command:

```
sedge run
```
