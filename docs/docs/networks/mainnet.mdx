# Mainnet

Mainnet is the public and decentralized network of Ethereum. It is the network that all validators participate in to
earn staking rewards, and it is the network that all users interact with to send transactions and store state. Mainnet is
secured by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on mainnet by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge cli` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge cli --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator
```

:::info

Sedge uses Mainnet as default network, therefore is not necessary to specify the target network.

:::

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys
```
