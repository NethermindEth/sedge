# Complete quickstart guide

Sedge is a one-click setup tool that you can use to set up and run a validator on Ethereum easily and without any prior knowledge. In this guide, you will go through every step in the validator setup using Sedge, along with detailed explanations for beginners. 

This is a beginner-friendly guide. Familiarity with the command line is expected, but otherwise, this guide makes no assumptions about your technical skills or prior knowledge.

## Overview

We will walk through the following steps:

1. Download and install Sedge in a new brand machine
2. Run Sedge's main workflow with default configuration values and use it to install dependencies (only for Linux)
3. Generate a `docker-compose` script with a randomized set of execution, consensus and validator clients
4. Run the `docker-compose` script
5. Generate validator keystore

The hardware specifications of the machine we are going to use are:

- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 200 SSD
- Ubuntu 22.04/amd64
 
### 1. Download and install Sedge in a new brand Linux machine

First open a console in the Home directory. Then use `curl` or `wget` to download a binary from the releases page (we will be using the `0.1.2` version). Check the [installation guide](install-guide) for more information or if you want to use another installation method:

<Tabs groupId="download-cmds">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

  ```
  curl -L https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/releases/download/0.1.2/sedge-v0.1.2-linux-amd64 --output sedge
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wget" label="wget">

  ```
  wget https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/releases/download/0.1.2/sedge-v0.1.2-linux-amd64 -O sedge
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

The `-O` flag is to rename binary as __sedge__

:::

:::note

The `$` symbol represents the Terminal prompt

:::

:::info

This guide assumes your Terminal session is pointing all the time to the folder in which you downloaded Sedge. You can check the directory pointed by your Terminal session if you execute `pwd`. 

:::

You can run `ls` to print the files and directories on the current directory and check the binary was downloaded correctly.

<!-- The following screenshot summarizes the above steps. Not important content was hidden so you can focus on the essential parts.

![download-and-ls](/img/download-sedge.png) -->

Set binary as executable executing `chmod +x sedge`. You shouldn't see any output or logs if the command was successful

**(Optional)** Run Sedge `./sedge --help` to check if the executable is ok. The `.` represents the current directory (where your terminal session is pointing to).

<!-- ![chmod-help](/img/chmod-and-help.png) -->

### 2. Run Sedge's main workflow with default configuration values

`cli` is Sedge's main command. This command takes care of the entire validator setup and is highly customizable. We will run it without flags and walk through the process:

- Initialization
  
    ```logs
    $ ./sedge cli

    Initializing configuration
    Config File ".sedge" Not Found in "[/home/sedge]"
    Config file not found on the path provided nor in the home directory
    # highlight-next-line
    Generating config file in the /home/sedge directory
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Logging configuration: {Level:info}
    # highlight-start
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [WARN] Execution client not provided. A random client will be selected. Random client: nethermind
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [WARN] Consensus and validator clients not provided. Selecting same pair of clients for consensus and validator clients using a random client. Random client: lighthouse
    # highlight-end
    ```

  :::info

  The `logs` shown by Sedge in every step will be displayed and explained. You should compare your `logs` with the ones in this guide to check everything went as expected. Note that some logs are **highlighted**.

  :::

    As you can see, a configuration file was generated. This configuration file is generated with default values and we don't need to worry about it for this guide. 

    As we didn't specify the clients to be used in the setup, they were randomly choosen. Nethermind was choosen as the execution client and Lighthouse for the consensus layer.

- Check if dependencies are installed
  
  ```
  2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Checking dependencies: docker
  ```

  <Tabs groupId="dependency-check">
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

  If a dependency is missing, Sedge will print instructions to install it and a prompt will be shown to let you decide between letting Sedge install it for you or exit and installing it on your own. (Only for Linux)

  ```logs

### 4. Run the `docker-compose` script

Instructions on how to run the docker-compose script will be displayed and next to it is a confirmation prompt.

```logs
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Instructions for running docker-compose script

docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d execution consensus

# highlight-next-line
? Run the script with the selected services execution, consensus? [Y/n]
```

Notice that it says "Run the script with the selected services **execution, consensus**?". This is because, by default, only these nodes will be up and running at the beginning, as they need to first sync with the network and this can take days.

> On some testnets the sync process takes hours depending on the network age and your internet bandwidth

Sedge will track the syncing progress of the execution and consensus nodes, and after they are completely synced, Sedge will automatically spin up the validator node. This gives you time to prepare the validator keystore (we will do that shortly) and to become familiar with the validator registration.

Now type `Y` or enter to start the following flow (You need to read carefully all the logs from now on):

:::info

Docker commands need to be executed with `sudo` by default, which requires root permissions and hence a **password prompt may arise**. Sedge only executes the commands that are shown in the logs, and you can also check the codebase to check that there's nothing nasty running under the hood. The codebase is public and fully visible on the Github repo.

:::

- Check if docker engine is on
    ```
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Checking if docker engine is on
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker ps -a
    ```
    Sedge runs `docker ps -a` to check if docker engine is on. You might have previously installed docker, but this does not mean docker is up and running. Docker engine is usually off when you use Docker Desktop and doesn't have the app on. If this is your case, just start Docker Desktop.

    In this case, docker engine is on.

- Run the docker-compose script
    
    In this step, the docker-compose script will be executed, which needs to pull the client's docker images from Docker Hub. This can take a while depending on your internet connection.

    ```
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d execution consensus
    [+] Running 13/13
    ⠿ consensus Pulled
        ⠿ 45ea9169a5e4 Pull complete
        ⠿ 9587c7a34752 Pull complete

    [+] Running 3/3
    ⠿ Network sedge_network       Created
    ⠿ Container consensus-client  Started
    ⠿ Container execution-client  Started
    ```

    The above logs are an example of healthy logs when going through this step.

- Display running nodes

    ```
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml ps --filter status=running
    NAME                COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
    consensus-client    "lighthouse bn --dis…"   consensus           running             0.0.0.0:5054->5054/tcp, :::5054->5054/tcp, 4000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp, :::9000->9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/udp, :::9000->9000/udp
    execution-client    "./Nethermind.Runner…"   execution           running             0.0.0.0:8008->8008/tcp, :::8008->8008/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30303->30303/tcp, :::30303->30303/tcp, 8545/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30303->30303/udp, :::30303->30303/udp
    ```

    Double check there are both `consensus-client` and `execution-client` entries. If one of them is missing then, something [has gone wrong](/docs/troubleshooting). 

- Futher instructions
    
    ```
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO]
    A validator node needs to connect to a synced consensus node, and the consensus node, in turn, needs to connect to a synced execution node.

    While these required nodes (execution/consensus) are syncing, you can setup the keystore folder(s) using the staking-deposit-cli tool (https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) or the command 'sedge keys'. If you don't want to use 'sedge keys', make sure to set .env variables KEYSTORE_DIR and VL_DATA_DIR to correct values. You can also check https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ for tips and more instructions.

    Sedge will track the syncing progress of the required nodes and let you run the validator after those nodes are synced (as we recommend). This takes a while, so you have time to prepare the keystore folder.

    Don't make the deposit to register the validator until it's ready to run!!!

    After you complete the above steps, follow https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ instructions to register the validator addresses of the validators you want to set up and manage using the validator node.
    ```

- Track sync of execution and consensus node

    First Sedge needs to get the IP address of the execution and consensus containers within the docker network. You don't need to worry about that if this is very technical for you.

    ```
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Proceding to get execution and consensus containers IP address for the monitoring tool
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml ps --quiet execution
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker inspect 13d0364c2ea3016c689def9b9e3e0f1d060ccca033274f3d30b8e2998a13a392

    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml ps --quiet consensus
    2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command: docker inspect 5f22960d056013b25a884e21462e019ee4ed50eccb3a065ba14cfa4eed17820e
    ```

    Now Sedge will use an external monitoring tool to track the syncing progress. Your logs should be similar to this:

    ```logs

    ```  

    **It's normal that some requests fail** at the beginning because the nodes are not ready yet. It should take a few minutes for the nodes to be ready. Once they are ready, you shouldn't see more failed requests unless there is a network problem in your machine or you shut down the nodes.

    **It's also normal to see some logs saying a node is synced** at the beginning. These are false reports from the node itself. Sedge knows how to handle this and can tell if a node is truly synced. 

    You will see logs like this for a long time and every 5 minutes (until the nodes are synced):

    ```
        2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Tracking sync progress of consensus nodes...
        2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Endpoint http://172.19.0.2:4000 is syncing
        2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Tracking sync progress of execution nodes...
        2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Endpoint http://172.19.0.3:8545 is syncing
    ```

:::info

The date and time of the logs were modified to show more generic logs. Until this step, and depending on your internet connection, the entire process should take just a few minutes.

### 5. Generate validator keystore

Sedge uses the [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) tool docker image for mainnet to generate the [validator keystore](/docs/concepts/keystore), and uses our own experimental code for the rest of the supported networks. 

:::caution Disclaimer

Users acknowledge that staking-deposit-cli is an external tool, which means that Nethermind exercises no control over its functioning and does not accept any liability for any issues that may arise from using the tool.

:::

:::caution Disclaimer

Users acknowledge that generating the keystore for any network other than the mainnet is an experimental and unaudited feature of Sedge. Nethermind provides this feature on an ‘as is’ basis and makes no warranties regarding its proper functioning. The use of this feature is at the user’s own risk - Nethermind excludes all liability for any malfunction or loss of money that may occur as the result of an unexpected behavior during the keystore generation.

:::

:::caution Disclaimer

Users need to carefully select the network while using `sedge keys` for keystore generation. User should use `--network` flag if the target network is different from mainnet.

:::

To get started, first open another Terminal on the same working directory we used before (where the binary is located). Then run the following command to quickly generate the keystore:

```
./sedge keys
```

The `keys` command will first check if Docker is installed (because use docker to run the staking-deposit-cli docker image). As we already installed Docker in the previous steps, Sedge will continue the process.

The next step involves a prompt for an Eth1 address to be used to create the [withdrawal credentials](/docs/concepts/keystore). If you don't provide one, then the tool will generate withdrawal credentials with the mnemonic-derived withdrawal public key.

```logs
Initializing configuration
Using config file: /Users/teno/.sedge.yaml
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Logging configuration: {Level:info}
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] All dependencies are installed on host machine
# highlight-next-line
✔ Please enter a Eth1 address to be used to create the withdrawal credentials. You can leave it blank and press enter:
```

The keystore must be secured with a password with a minimum length of 8. Sedge will ask you to provide this password so it can be used by the staking-deposit-cli to secure the generated keystore and then create a `keystore_password.txt` for the validator node. The password input will be hidden so you don't need to worry about your password getting registered in the Terminal logs or history.

```
✔ Please enter the password you will use for the validator keystore: ********█
Please enter the password you will use for the validator keystore: ********
✔ Please re-enter the password. Press Ctrl+C to retry: ********
```

:::info

A **password prompt** may show up again because Sedge uses docker commands to run the staking-deposit-cli docker image, and these commands need to be executed with `sudo` by default. The required password is your **machine password**, not the keystore password.

:::

From here, the rest of the flow belongs to the staking-deposit-cli tool:

```
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Generating keystore folder
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Running command:
docker run -it --rm -v /home/sedge/docker-compose-scripts/keystore/validator_keys:/app/validator_keys nethermindeth/staking-deposit-cli new-mnemonic --chain mainnet --keystore_password ********
Please choose your language ['1. العربية', '2. ελληνικά', '3. English', '4. Français', '5. Bahasa melayu', '6. Italiano', '7. 日本語', '8. 한국어', '9. Português do Brasil', '10. român', '11. 简体中文']:  [English]:
Repeat your keystore password for confirmation:
```

:::caution

Be sure to type correctly the keystore password previously provided to Sedge. If you don't insert the same password, then staking-deposit-cli will ask you to create a new password. If this happens, you have two options:

1. Exit the program and try again.
2. Finish the execution flow, generating the keystore successfully in the process. Then you need to update the `keystore_password.txt` file inside the `keystore` folder with the password you provided to the staking-deposit-cli tool. 

:::

The staking-deposit-cli tool lets you create a keystore using an existing mnemonic or by creating a new one. By default, Sedge's `keys` command goes with creating a new mnemonic.

```
Please choose your mnemonic language ['1. 简体中文', '2. 繁體中文', '3. čeština', '4. English', '5. Italiano', '6. 한국어', '7. Português', '8. Español']:  [english]:
Please choose how many new validators you wish to run:
```

:::tip

One validator node can handle hundreds of validators (validator keys). We recommend to run at most 500 validators within a single validator node. We will go with 1 validator this time.

:::

After you choose how many new validators you wish to run, a newly generated mnemonic will be displayed. You must copy it using safe methods such as pen and paper. Then you will be asked to insert the mnemonic for validation. This is the final step, after which the keystore will be generated:

```
                  #####     #####
                ##     #####     ##
    ###         ##   #######     #########################

   ##             ###              ##                   ##
   ###############                 ##                   ##
   ###               ##                                 ##

```

The above logs mark the end of the staking-deposit-cli execution and Sedge retakes control of the flow:

```logs
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] deposit-cli tool exited
# highlight-next-line
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] If everything went well, your keys can be found at: /home/sedge/docker-compose-scripts/keystore/validator_keys
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] keystore_password.txt on keystore folder created with provided password
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [WARN] In case you used custom paths for the 'cli' or the 'keys' commands, please review if the keystore path in the generated .env file points to the generated keystore folder (the .env key should be KEYSTORE_DIR). If not, change the path in the .env file to the correct one.
```

As we stick to default configuration values all the time, we can ignore the final log. 

Your keystore folder should look similar to this:

```
docker-compose-scripts
    └── keystore
        ├── keystore_password.txt
        └── validator_keys
            ├── deposit_data-1659326409.json
            └── keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1659326408.json
```

:::note

A guide for using our own experimental code for keystore generation is coming soon!

### 6. Final steps

When the execution and consensus clients are finally synced you will see the following logs:

  ```logs
  2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Tracking sync progress of consensus nodes...
  2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [ETH2 Monitor] [TrackSync] Endpoint http://172.19.0.2:4000 is synced

  2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Instructions for running validator service of docker-compose script

  docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d validator

  # highlight-next-line
  ? Run validator service? [Y/n]
  ```

Now you can proceed and finish the setup by pressing `Y`. This will run the validator service with it your validator client will be up and running. Make sure you created or prepared the keystore folder before this step. If you forgot to do it you can take your time, prepare the keystore folder and then press `Y`. This will also take you to the final logs, which describe how the validator is being run:

  ```logs

  Validator is up. Remember to set up the keystore folder and to make the deposit. If something went wrong and your validator node is down, don't panic! Short downtimes are not very bad. Check the logs and try to fix the errors. Make sure errors are not related to connection issues with the consensus nodes or related to the keystore folder path or validator data directory. You can start the validator again using the instructions displayed by the tool.

  Happy Staking!
  ```

### Conclusions

Congratulations, you just installed and executed your first validator (and Ethereum full node) using Sedge. The only thing left is making the ETH deposit using the `deposit_data.json` you just generated and wait for the validator to be registered in the network.
