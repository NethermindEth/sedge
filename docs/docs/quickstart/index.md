# Quickstart

Sedge dependencies are Docker with the Docker Compose plugin, but if you don't have those installed, Sedge will show instructions to install them, or install them for you. You can find more information in the [Dependencies page](dependencies).

Pre-built binaries are available for both macOS and Linux, and you can also build from source. Check the [Installation guide](install-guide) for detailed instructions.

A complete tour on using Sedge for setting up a validator or full Ethereum node (because the setup involves an execution and consensus clients) can be found in the [Complete quickstart guide](complete-guide).

Other guides in this section shows you how to setup a validator with only one step, and also how to setup a validator with mev-boost.

For a tour of Sedge's design and features, see the [Overview](/docs/overview).
